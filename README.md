# Digital Design VHDL

This repository contains VHDL implementations of various digital design components and systems. The goal is to demonstrate knowledge and practical skills in digital design, including counters, ALUs, and BCD converters.

## Contents

- **bin_to_BCD**: Converts binary numbers (0-255) to Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD).
- **Top_LEVEL**: The top-level module that integrates various components, including counters and BCD converters.
- **Counter**: Implements a simple up-counter.
- **ALU**: Arithmetic Logic Unit that performs basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- **MUX**: Multiplexer to select between different data inputs.
- **DEMUX**: Demultiplexer to distribute a single input to multiple outputs.
- **7-Segment Display**: Converts BCD to 7-segment display outputs.
- **J-K Flip-Flop**: Implementation of the J-K Flip-Flop.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kareemnat12/DigitalDesignVHDL.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your VHDL simulation tool.

3. Compile the design files and run simulations to test the functionality of each component.

## Example Simulation

To run an example simulation, follow these steps:

- Load the `Top_LEVEL` module in your simulation environment.
- Apply appropriate test benches to observe the output.

## Requirements

- VHDL simulation tool (e.g., ModelSim, Vivado).
- Basic understanding of digital design concepts and VHDL syntax.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
